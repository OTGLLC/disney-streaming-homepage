1. You can set the size of the window to either (1920x1080) or (960x540) by replacing a config file. You can also manually adjust the parameters within the config file; however, the rendering is not set up to correctly handler independent resolution rendering. 
2. The project uses a data cache for shaders, textures on config files. You can find the folders within their respective release folders
3. Be patient with the loading screen, adding a loading indicator added a bit more to my scope for now
4. There is minimal response to input. The tiles can be selected but there is no scrolling.

Controls for the Tile selection
"W" - Up
"A" - Left
"D" - Right
